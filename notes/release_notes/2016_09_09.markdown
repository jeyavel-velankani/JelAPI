QM v2016_09_09 (Sep 9) Release


Deployed to:
dev server


Changelog:
* topup sponsorship api is implemented (quota_increment is assumed to be > 0. <=0 will result in invalid_quota_increment error). The quota_increment value (in megabytes) is added to the existing quota_bytes_total and quota_bytes_unclaimed fields.


Fixed Issues:
* All API requests now have to be content-type 'application/json'. Otherwise 'invalid_request' error response will be received.
* Passing values like "123INVALID" to mno_id or sponsorship_id in create-sponsorship or read-sponsorship apis will now fail. (reported by Karthik)
