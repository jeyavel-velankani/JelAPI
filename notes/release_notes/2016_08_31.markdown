## Changelog
* subscriber-side apis: retrieve, deactivate, and report quotas usage: With respect to quota_report list, all these 3 apis behave consistently now as per Luke's email
* subscriber-side: register api: passing blank auth_token will now return 'invalid auth_token' error
* subscriber-side: register: re-registering will now update auth_token and machine_id
* Earlier, for a valid sponsorship id (say 1000), passing '1000' and '1000INV' succeeded. Now, only '1000' will succeed.
