## Deployed to:
dev and opswork server

## Changelog
* admin api added. The session expiration value is looked up from the AppConfig table only on non-production env. For Production, it comes from a constant within the code. This will save time by reducing 1 DB lookup. Please see below for the admin apis.

* subscriber register api - 
a)redirect URL parameter added to the SUCCESSFUL response from  register api. This url can be edited from admin panel.

b) Two factor sms text has been changed to “SDX Authorization Code:<the code>” . This is also configurable from admin panel.

* Sponsor create-sponsorship - presentation-data parameter included in the success response.
