# Sep 28 Release Notes

Deployed to
dev QM server and integration QM server


Changelog
* Subscriber apis: two factor authentication for registration api

Test Case Report
* All relevant test cases are passing in the server (see attached screenshot). Steps to run them in the server:
  1) cd /home/Velankani/apps/sdx_qm/current
  2) RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails test test/integration/subscriber_apis/ test/integration/sponsor_apis/ test/integration/call_data_record/ test/integration/claimed_and_unclaimed_bytes/ test/integration/auth_apis/check_for_sponsorship_updates_test.rb

Note
* For two factor authentication in test mode auth code is '111111'
* The mode can be changed in admin panel from app config tab. The three allowed options are 'ON', TEST' and 'OFF'. The record name is '2fa_mode' . By default the value is set as 'OFF'. Adding dropdown for a specific field (2fa_mode) will be hard. So, Not implementing it now. But we have added hints in the form.
* If two factor authentication enabled then for the first time "Authorization code required" message will be returned.
