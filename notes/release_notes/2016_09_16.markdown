Fixed Issues:
* datamodel issues fixed: The MNO and ControlApp lookup is now based on the newly added fields - sdx_mno_id(int), sdx_app_id(int) - in the respective tables. (Earlier it was using the primary key column "id")

* Instead of the primary key 'id's, these sdx ids are now shown in the read/retrieve sponsorship(s) api response

* MNO name is now added in the read/retrieve sponsorship(s) responses

* Transaction Log entity now seen in admin UI
