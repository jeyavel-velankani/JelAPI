Sep 7 Release Notes


Changelog:
* updating bytes claimed/unclaimed columns (to test this fully, the topup api is needed, which is not yet done. To simulate that, edit and update the quota_bytes_total and quota_bytes_unclaimed values of the spship from the admin UI).
* canned response for these sponsor-side apis: topup, suspend, resume, terminate sponsorships
* In dev server, the QM application now logs to /var/log/syslog file via the rsyslog service. The logging is no more done in the current/staging.log file.
* msisdn validation - 0 to 15 chars in length. Couldn't find any specific validation for not allowing special characters.

Test Case Report:
* All relevant test cases are passing in the server (see attached screenshot). Steps to run them in the server:
  1) cd /home/Velankani/apps/sdx_qm/current
  2) RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails test test/integration/subscriber_apis/ test/integration/sponsor_apis/ test/integration/call_data_record/ test/integration/claimed_and_unclaimed_bytes/
