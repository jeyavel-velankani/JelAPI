August 26 Release


## Changelog
* sponsor-side apis done:
  - read-sponsorship



Fixed Issues
* quota_bytes field mysql datatype - changed to signed bigint.
It's max is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
which is 2^63 - 1,
not 2^64 as you had wanted.

But with (2^63 - 1) as maxvalue, we can represent, in QM, 8796093022207 MB, which is ~8.4 million terabytes. http://www.matisse.net/bitcalc/?input_amount=8796093022207&input_units=megabytes&notation=legacy
The actual value saved in the sponsorships table for this MB value is: 9223372036853727232 (which is close to the above mentioned max value)

To be able to use 2^64, we need to use the unsigned bigint datatype in mysql.
Problems with that:
only mysql has unsigned integer. Notably, postgresql doesn't have. So in future, if we have to change datatypes, it might be a problem.
Rails doesnt' have a native way to express unsigned bigint which isn't compatible with all DBs its ORM supports.

* Sponsors can now create multiple sponsorships with same name. (removed composite uniq index).

* Fixed Admin interface issues with creating sponsorships.

* Session expiration values are now read from a table called app_configs. In the admin interface, you can find it in "AppConfig" menu.

* Sponsorship creation will fail if quota_bytes_total not in this range: > 0 and < (2^63 - 1)
